# Research Question
**Analyze the parallels between AI decision-making in schnapsen and human approaches to risk assessment during gameplay.**

## About
Our project tries to recreate and assess the relevant brain regions that contribute to risk assessment during gameplay in the card game [schnapsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnapsen). It attempts to quantify and visualize the similarities between the human brain and neural networks.

## Getting started
- Using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git
- From Zip: Download it using the green `<> code` button above

## Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)

Optional:
- [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html)

## Key code components
We're following the [Black Python style guide](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html) for code formatting.
- class `Brain`:
    + Comprised of all the relevant regions in the brain
    + Main implementation of the neural network
- class `Region`:
    + Base class for all regions of the brain
    + Contains all relevant methods _| Keep in mind that the implementation **will** vary accross different regions._
- function `main`:
    + Main entry point of the application
    + Application set up is done within this function
