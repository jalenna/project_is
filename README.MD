# Risk Assessment in AI
Analyze the parallels between AI decision-making in schnapsen and human approaches to risk assessment during gameplay.

## About
Our project tries to recreate and assess the relevant brain regions that contribute to risk assessment during gameplay in the card game [schnapsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnapsen). It attempts to quantify and visualize the similarities between the human brain and neural networks.

## Getting started
- [ ] _TODO_

## Structure and usage
- class `Brain`:
    + Comprised of all the relevant regions in the brain
    + Main implementation of the neural network
- class `Region`:
    + Base class for all regions of the brain
    + Contains all relevant methods _| Keep in mind that the implementation **will** vary accross different regions._
- function `main`:
    + Main entry point of the application
    + Application set up is done within this function
