# Research Question
**What are the parallels between AI decision-making in schnapsen and human approaches to risk assessment during gameplay?**

## About
Our project aims to recreate and assess the relevant brain regions that contribute to risk assessment during gameplay in the card game [schnapsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnapsen). It attempts to quantify and visualize the similarities between the human brain and neural networks.

## Getting started
- Using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git
- From Zip: Download this repository using the green `<> code` button above and extract the contents to a separate folder. Then enter that folder and proceed

Open a terminal and run `python main.py`. Alternatively, in VSCode, right-click `main.py` and click `Run Python File in Terminal`.

If all went well you should see a message by tensorflow and the required files being created and displayed.

## Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
- [Schnapsen](https://pypi.org/project/schnapsen/)

Optional:
- [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html)
- A basic understanding of [Neural Networks](./BRAIN_OVERVIEW.md)

## Disclaimer
This project aims to create a very basic and simplified version of the brain. We do not expect to recreate the entire brain and have it function in the exact way. With that being said, we do, however expect to find similarities between humans and Neural Networks in their performance during gameplay.
